    <h1>Presentation Layer</h1>
    <p>
        Within the service layering semantics of the OSI network architecture, 
        the presentation layer responds to service requests from the application layer and issues service requests 
        to the session layer through a unique presentation service access point (PSAP).[5]
    </p>
        The presentation layer ensures the information that the application layer of one system sends out is readable 
        by the application layer of another system. On the sending system it is responsible for conversion to standard, 
        transmittable formats.[6] On the receiving system it is responsible for the translation, formatting, and delivery 
        of information for processing or display. [7] In theory, it relieves application layer protocols of concern regarding 
        syntactical differences in data representation within the end-user systems. An example of a presentation service would 
        be the conversion of an extended binary coded decimal interchange code (EBCDIC-coded) text computer file to an ASCII-coded 
        file. If necessary, the presentation layer might be able to translate between multiple data formats using a common format.
