    <h1>Physical Layer</h1>
    <p>
        In the seven-layer OSI model of computer networking, 
        the physical layer or layer 1 is the first and lowest layer; 
        The layer most closely associated with the physical connection between devices. 
        This layer may be implemented by a PHY chip.
    </p>
    <p>
        The physical layer defines the means of transmitting a stream of raw bits[2] over a
         physical data link connecting network nodes. The bitstream may be grouped into code 
         words or symbols and converted to a physical signal that is transmitted over a transmission 
         medium. The physical layer provides an electrical, mechanical, and procedural interface to the 
         transmission medium. The shapes and properties of the electrical connectors, the frequencies 
         to broadcast on, the line code to use and similar low-level parameters, are specified by the physical layer.
