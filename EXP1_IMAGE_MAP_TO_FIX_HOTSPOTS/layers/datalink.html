    <h1>Datalink Layer</h1>
    <p>
        The data link layer, or layer 2, is the second layer of the seven-layer OSI model of 
        computer networking. This layer is the protocol layer that transfers data between nodes
         on a network segment across the physical layer.[2] The data link layer provides the functional
          and procedural means to transfer data between network entities and may also provide the means 
          to detect and possibly correct errors that can occur in the physical layer.
    </p>
    <p>
        The data link layer is concerned with local delivery of frames between nodes 
        on the same level of the network. Data-link frames, as these protocol data 
        units are called, do not cross the boundaries of a local area network. 
        Inter-network routing and global addressing are higher-layer functions, allowing 
        data-link protocols to focus on local delivery, addressing, and media arbitration. 
        In this way, the data link layer is analogous to a neighborhood traffic cop; it endeavors 
        to arbitrate between parties contending for access to a medium, without concern for their 
        ultimate destination. When devices attempt to use a medium simultaneously, frame collisions occur. 
        Data-link protocols specify how devices detect and recover from such collisions, and may provide 
        mechanisms to reduce or prevent them.
